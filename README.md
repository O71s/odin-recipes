# odin-recipes

Hello there, I'm Otis.
I'm currently following The Odin Project since i'm interested in learning Web Development. 
I hope I can expand my knowledge with this project. 
My goal is to make a clean looking recipe website, I will put as much work in as possible hoping for good results.

Cheers!
